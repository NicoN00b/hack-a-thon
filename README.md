## Description/Setup/Installation Requirements

This is a project for the Epicodus Java Track.  It requires and IDE (I used IntelliJ ), Spark, and a browser.  Additionally, the user will be prompted to import various libraries if they are not automatically rendered

## Known Bugs

The original Member Class went unused.  Most of my project time was spent trying to figure out how to get it to work with the front-end (Handlebars specifically) after successful tests. As of now, adding members in the App will lead to a road of ruin... You may not initially see a 404 or 500 error message, but they are out there waiting for you.  Be forewarned.
